    Version 1.3
    database dumped to single file.
    bug fixed for slow reading, when using STL map, vector
    when pass them to function arguments
    use map<string,string> &a 
    e.g. 

LOG: 2011-10-18 16:02:11 Tuesday  Week 42 <nanjiang@illergard>
    int myfunction1(map<string,string>&dict,string filename)
    if without &, it can be extremely slow since the whole content of the map
        or vector will be passed to the function
